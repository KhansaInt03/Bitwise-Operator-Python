# Bitwise-Operator-Python
A Bitwise Operator with Python Language

A simple Python project where I create an application for bitwise operations like XOR, AND, OR, NOT, etc. Here is some example.

1st example.
What would you like to do?
[1] XOR
[2] OR
[3] AND
[4] NOT
[5] Shift Left
[6] Shift Right
>> 5

Binary : 10101011
Shift Value : 10
Result as binary :0101010110000000000
Result as character : 𪰀

2nd example.
What would you like to do?
[1] XOR
[2] OR
[3] AND
[4] NOT
[5] Shift Left
[6] Shift Right
>> 2

Binary 1 : 11111101
Binary 1 : 00011100
Result as binary :011111101
Result as character : ý

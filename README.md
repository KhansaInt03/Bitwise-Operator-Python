# Bitwise-Operator-Python
A Bitwise Operator with Python Language

A simple Python project where I create an application for bitwise operations like XOR, AND, OR, NOT, etc. Here is some example.

1st example.

- Binary : 10101011
- Shift Value : 10
- Result as binary :0101010110000000000
- Result as character : 𪰀

2nd example.

- Binary 1 : 11111101
- Binary 1 : 00011100
- Result as binary :011111101
- Result as character : ý
